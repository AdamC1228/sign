The content is stored in a database somewhere else
This program reads from a config file, stored in ~/.config/sign, connects
to a database, pulls down the information and then
displays the contents in something that looks like a web page

contents of ~/.config/sign
database username and password,
the location id of where this sign is
It'll look like this:
